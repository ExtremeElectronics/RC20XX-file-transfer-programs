# Python instalation

As with most python programs, the issue is not with the programs, but getting a working set of python modules and paths

### All tools
These tools need python3.6 or greater

All of the tools require the pyserial module, this is usually installed with pip or pip3
e.g. "pip3 install pyserial"

### Windows/X GUI tools
For these you will need tkinter, in windows this is provided along with the python package. 
In Linux you may have to add this to your OS as a installable "package" in your OS's package manager
e.g apt-get install python-tk 

For ffexplorer you will need the tkinterdnd2 package this is usually installed with pip or pip3
e.g. "pip3 install tkinterdnd2"

## Apple MAC / IPAD 
Glad you asked, not a clue :) but I'm sure with a bit of python knoledge they are installable. 
If you have a method that works, please contact me and I'll add it here
